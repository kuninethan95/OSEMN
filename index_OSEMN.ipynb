    "> <font size=2em>The Data Science Process we'll be using during this section--OSEMiN (pronounced \"OH-sum\", rhymes with \"possum\").  This is the most straightforward of the Data Science Processes discussed so far.  **Note that during this process, just like the others, the stages often blur together.***  It is completely acceptable (and ***often a best practice!) to float back and forth** between stages as you learn new things about your problem, dataset, requirements, etc.  \n",
    "It's quite common to get to the modeling step and realize that you need to scrub your data a bit more or engineer a different feature and jump back to the \"Scrub\" stage, or go all the way back to the \"Obtain\" stage when you realize your current data isn't sufficient to solve this problem. \n",
    "As with any of these frameworks, *OSEMiN is meant to be treated as guidelines, not law. \n",

    "- This step involves understanding stakeholder requirements, gathering information on the problem, and finally sourcing data that we think will be necessary for solving this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SCRUB**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During this stage, we'll focus on preprocessing our data.  Important steps such as identifying and removing null values, dealing with outliers, normalizing data, and feature engineering/feature selection are handled around this stage.  The line with this stage really blurs with the _Explore_ stage, as it is common to only realize that certain columns require cleaning or preprocessing as a result of the visualzations and explorations done during Step 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that although technically, categorical data should be one-hot encoded during this step, in practice, it's usually done after data exploration.  This is because it is much less time-consuming to visualize and explore a few columns containing categorical data than it is to explore many different dummy columns that have been one-hot encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "**EXPLORE**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This step focuses on getting to know the dataset you're working with. As mentioned above, this step tends to blend with the _Scrub_ step mentioned above.  During this step, you'll create visualizations to really get a feel for your dataset.  You'll focus on things such as understanding the distribution of different columns, checking for multicollinearity, and other tasks liek that.  If your project is a classification task, you may check the balance of the different classes in your dataset.  If your problem is a regression task, you may check that the dataset meets the assumptions necessary for a regression task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- At the end of this step, you should have a dataset ready for modeling that you've thoroughly explored and are extremely familiar with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**MODEL**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This step, as with the last two frameworks, is also pretty self-explanatory. It consists of building and tuning models using all the tools you have in your data science toolbox.  In practice, this often means defining a threshold for success, selecting machine learning algorithms to test on the project, and tuning the ones that show promise to try and increase your results.  As with the other stages, it is both common and accepted to realize something, jump back to a previous stage like _Scrub_ or _Explore_, and make some changes to see how it affects the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**iNTERPRET**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During this step, you'll interpret the results of your model(s), and communicate results to stakeholders.  As with the other frameworks, communication is incredibily important! During this stage, you may come to realize that further investigation is needed, or more data.  That's totally fine--figure out what's needed, go get it, and start the process over! If your results are satisfactory to all stakeholders involved, you may also go from this stage right into productionizing your model and automating processes necessary to support it.  \n",

    "Cyrptocurrencies have grown in popularity and market capitalization as corporations, retail investors, and individual adopt them as means of transactions and as a store of value. Bitcoin, introduced to the world in 2008 was the first cryptocurrency and still the largest as a percentage of market share. However, Ethereum and a host of other coins have been making their way into the mainstream. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary concerns that regulators and investors have with cryptocurrencies is their association with malicious activity. Because transactions are anonymous and decentralized, they became useful for purchasing goods and services on dark web markets like Silk Road. With anonymous transactions came fraud. Since users have no way of verrifying who is on the other end of the transaction, people are regularly 'scammed' and defrauded. For widespread adoption, this obviously presents a concern because people need to trust that their transactions are being properly executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model I have designed adds a safeguard for transferring ethereum. If the model believs the transaction may be fraudelent, it will warn the user before they confirm the transaction. Think of this as an equivalent service to when your bank alerts you that their may have been a suspicious transaction on your credit card. Ideally, this service would be built into an existing cryptocurrency wallet. \n"

I suspect they are missing because the owner of the wallet did not know that the transactions were being made because they were hacked. The second strongest correlation is time diff between first and last which represents the number of minutes between the first and last transaction. This represents how long the wallet has been in use. The longer the wallet has been in use, the less liklihood that it has been a victim of fraudulant transactions because it has a negative correlation. Most of the correlation values are very low."

    "\n",
    "The purpose of the model is to accurately predict fraudulent transactions. I am prioritizing recall over other evaluation metrics because the cost of false negative is greater than the cost of false positive. If a customer receives a notification for potential fraud that is not fraud, there is a little harm. If the model suspects fraud, but does not notify the customer because it is more focused on precision, the damages are higher. Can quanitify the value of the model by seeing how it compares to a dummy model, and then calculating how much in ether it would have saved if it notified customers of fraud. \n",
    "\n",
    "There should be two types of models. One model will evaluate fraud based purely off of ethereum transactions, the other will evaluate fraud based off of ethereum and ERC20 transactions. 60% of the crypto market share is in either Bitcoin or Ethereum. Bitcoins controls 40% of the market share, Ethereum 20%, and the next largest coin controls 2.5% of the market share. These ERC20 tokens are relatively unpopular so I'd like to have one model that solely focuses on detecting fraud based on Ethereum because it is a more prevalent asset class"

    "- Overall, compared to the dummy, the KNN model performed very well on the training and test set\n",
    "- In the dummy, the model detected fraud 52% of the time, in the final KNN model, it was able to accurately detect fraud 92% of the time, a 40% improvement\n",
    "- Out of all valid transactions, it accurately predicted 98%\n",
    "    - Of the 2% that are misclassified, the only harm is that the customer will receive a notification saying that the transaction they are initiating may be fraudulent\n",
    "    - They can confirm or deny this and proceed to send the funds\n",
    "- For fraudulant cases, the median of the average value sent in a transaction is 0.5 ETH. The 200 moving day average (the average price of ETH the past 200 days) is \\$1,528\n",
    "    - While there is no official number, BTC and ETH have clearly been the target of hacks and we shall say that 5% of all wallets will be hacked at some point in existance\n",
    "    - If a wallet service has 10,000 users, it can expect 500 of them to experience some sort of fraud. Given that the median average value sent out per accounts that experience fraud is 0.5 ETH, these customers are losing \\$764\n",
    "    - The dummy model can predict fraud 50% of the time. So 250 people will experience fraud costing them \\\\$764 each for a total loss of \\$191,000\n",
    "    - Of course, this is bad business for the wallet company, the users are highly likely to transfer their funds to another wallet service after experiencing fraud\n",
    "    - If the company were to use the KNN model that we have tuned, it would detect fraud 92% of the time\n",
    "        - Out of the 500 customers who would hypothetically experience fraud, only 40 customers would experience fraud because the model would notify the customer before sending the suspicious transaction\n",
    "        - 40 customers causes a total loss of $30,560\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: Out of 10,000 customers, the company can expect that 500 of them will be targeted for fraud. Using the model, rather than 250 of them being impacted by fraud, only 30 of them will be\n",
    "    - This reduces potential losses from \\\\$191,000 to \\$30,560, an 84% decrease in costs\n",
    "    - Additinally, 88% fewere customers will be affected by fraud\n",
